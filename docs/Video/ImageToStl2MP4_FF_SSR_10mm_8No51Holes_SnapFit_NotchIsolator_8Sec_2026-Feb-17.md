Next‑Gen stackable Bi‑Energy Hybrid Core for 10 mm glass systems

A twin‑disk thermal module illustrating static convective energy conversion.
Each SS430 stainless‑steel disk delivers impulsive radiant and conductive energy into SiC foam, while its floating Inconel X‑750 open‑ring support prevents efficiency losses and provides a resilient snap‑fit interface. The entire assembly is modular and mechanically indexed.

A/B orientation (holes/notches + alignment tab) induces a controlled laminar torsion of airflow into a high‑porosity SiC central matrix, maximizing heat exchange. This enables a two‑phase usage mode where pre‑heat and inhalation can be performed independently or combined as needed.

Impulse‑heating vaporization promotes full‑spectrum delivery without the secondary or tertiary thermal degradation associated with combustion, the latter being both harmful and inefficient.
